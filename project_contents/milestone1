Milestone #1
Goal: Build an index

Building the inverted index:
Now that you have been provided the HTML files to index, you may build your
inverted index off of them. The inverted index is simply a map with the token as a
key and a list of its corresponding postings. A posting is the representation of the
token’s occurrence in a document. The posting typically (not limited to) contains the
following info (you are encouraged to think of other attributes that you could add to
the index):
• The document name/id the token was found in.
• Its tf-idf score for that document

Some tips:
• When designing your inverted index, you will think about the structure of
your posting first.
• You would normally begin by implementing the code to calculate/fetch the
elements which will constitute your posting.
• Modularize. Use scripts/classes that will perform a function or a set of closely
related functions. This helps in keeping track of your progress, debugging,
and also dividing work amongst teammates if you’re in a group.
• We strongly recommend you use GitHub as a mechanism to work with your
team members on this project.

Deliverables: Submit a report (pdf) to with the following content: a table with
assorted numbers pertaining to your index. It should have, at least the number of
documents, the number of [unique] tokens, and the total size (in KB) of your index
on disk.
Note for the developer option: at this time, you don’t need to have the optimized
index.

Evaluation criteria:
- Did your report show up on time?
- Are the reported numbers plausible?
